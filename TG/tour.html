                   Americans seek similar attractions, as well as recreation and vacation areas.
                   Tourism in the United States grew rapidly in the form of urban tourism during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 
                   By the 1850s, tourism in the United States was well established both as a cultural activity and as an industry. 
                   New York City, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, all major U.S. cities, attracted numerous tourists by the 1890s.
                    By 1915, city touring had marked significant shifts in the way Americans perceived, organized, and moved.
                    Democratization of travel occurred during the early twentieth century when the automobile revolutionized travel.
                     Similarly air travel revolutionized travel during 1945–1969, contributing greatly to tourism in the United States. Purchases of travel and tourism-related goods and services by international visitors traveling in the United States totaled $10.9 billion during February 2013.
